###1. Install Node.js

Ox requires nodejs to be installed so that it can run the automation tools.
If you haven't installed Node.js yet, <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager" target="_blank">view these instructions</a>.

###2. Download ox

[Download](https://github.com/OttoRobba/ox/archive/master.zip) and unzip the ox framework into a directory.

###3. Run `npm install`

Open the command line (cmd in Windows, terminal in OS X or Linux) and move into the folder you extracted using the `cd` command. Run `npm install` to install required packages locally or `npm install -g` to install them globally so that you don't have to re-install them for every project you do.
