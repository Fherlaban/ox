###1. Enter the project directory

Open the command line (cmd in Windows, terminal in OS X or Linux) and move into your project folder using the `cd` command.

###2. Run `npm start`
This will watch for changes in your project, automatically updating the list of assets, entities and scenes. It will also run Browserify, concatenating all scripts into a single file and run a server with BrowserSync. The browser should open automatically when you run this command - and it refreshes automatically, as you make changes to your files.
