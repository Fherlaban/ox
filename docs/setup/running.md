###1. Enter the project directory

Open the command line (cmd in Windows, terminal in OS X or Linux) and move into the folder you extracted using the `cd` command.

###2. Run `npm start`
This will watch for changes in the assets folders, automatically rebuilding the list of assets, entities and scenes. It will also run Browserify, concatenating all scripts into a single file and run a server with BrowserSync.
