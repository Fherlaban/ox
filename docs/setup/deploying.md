###1. Enter the project directory

Open the command line (cmd in Windows, terminal in OS X or Linux) and move into your project folder using the `cd` command.

###2. Run `npm run deploy`
This will create a file called `game.js` at your root folder. This file is already minified and includes every `js` file from your game. Copy it, along with the assets folders (audio, images, data) when distributing your game.
